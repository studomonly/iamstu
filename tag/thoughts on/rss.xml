  <p>“The problem is that you’re very logical, and logic isn’t the only way to look at things.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder how many people have been criticised with a similar sentiment as the one above. It seems like the standard reply if I’m being too formal in how I approach a topic. It’s as if, somehow, the realm of logic belongs to Scientists and Spock. Everyone else, apparently, uses something else?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes, your arguments are very logical, but my beliefs are not based on logic. They are spiritual.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are spirituality and logic inherently incompatible? The point I would like to get across in this article, is that everyone uses logic. Logical argument comes very naturally to all of us. It is also possible to make a spiritual argument using logic. This is because, logic is only as good as the assumptions that you make.</p>

<p>Let’s begin by asking, what is logic? The dictionary definition says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I can see with a definition like that, no wonder it is off-putting. If I were to write a definition of logic, here is what mine would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Logic is a framework that makes it possible to draw conclusions. You evaluate the stuff you know to infer more stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s walk through an example of something really simple. Let’s start in a world where we know absolutely nothing, and I’ll introduce information gradually.</p>

<p>Statement 1:
<code>Oranges are a fruit.</code></p>

<p>The above statement is great for logic, because it can be evaluated as either true or false. For now, we will assume it’s true. Let’s introduce another statement. Remember in this world, we actually don’t know what an Orange or a Fruit is.</p>

<p>Statement 2:
<code>Boris likes fruit.</code></p>

<p>We now have two statements about our world. The process of logic comes into play whenever we are able to derive 
more information by connecting the information we currently have.</p>

<p><img src="/iamstu//assets/images/thoughts-on-logic/boris.jpg" alt="Boris likes Oranges" /></p>

<p>Statement 3:
<code>Boris likes Oranges.</code></p>

<p>If statement 1 and 2 are true, then we can conclude that statement 3 is also true. We actually don’t need to know what “Oranges” are. We don’t need to know what a “Fruit” is. We can substitute both of those words for something else. If statements 1 and 2 are true, then 3 will always be true too. I’ll substitute in some random examples here just to demonstate the point:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>Cheesecakes are a Spaceship.</code></li>
  <li><code>George V of Bulgaria likes Spaceships.</code></li>
  <li><code>George V of Bulgaria likes Cheesecakes.</code></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/iamstu//assets/images/thoughts-on-logic/bulgaria-cheesecake-george.jpg" alt="George V of Bulgaria likes Cheesecakes" /></p>

<p>It makes no sense in the context of our own world. However, inferring statement 3 from statements 1 and 2 is logical. Logic has it’s power as a mechanism for drawing conclusions. It’s abstract, in that you don’t need context for it to work. Which makes the subject mathematical, but that doesn’t mean it’s automatically complicated or should be discounted as only for mathematicians.</p>

<p>So what do we mean when we say something is illogical? Being illogical is drawing a conclusion that is counter to the information we have. For example, let’s refer back to the Orange and Fruit. I introduce the following:</p>

<p>Statement 4:
<code>Boris  does not like Oranges.</code></p>

<p>Inferring statement 4 from statements 1 and 2 would be illogical. However, if we later observed Boris throwing away an Orange in disgust, we shouldn’t criticise our logic. We should criticise the information that we have which lead us to that conclusion. Logic is our friend, in that it helps us make sense out of information. The accuracy of information is a whole other issue. You could use Science to judge the accuracy of a statement. To do this, you’d have to test the statement. Your statement becomes a hypothesis. If the hypothesis consistently holds under experimentation it’s probably true. If it fails, it can’t be true. If you wanted to use some other method to decide if your assumptions are true, you are free to do so. You just wouldn’t have the benefit of knowing that your approach has succeeded in keeping planes in the air, cured numerous diseases and developed technologies which have improved the lives of millions.</p>

<p>In summary, to those who feel that logic isn’t for them; it probably is. For the most part i’m sure you’re already using it. You might, for example, assume that a religious text is literally true. There are a whole host of logical conclusions you could draw because of that. My challenge will be of your base assumptions. I won’t criticise you for using logic.</p>
